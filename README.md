### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

> My name is **Sasha**. My hobby is making apps and constantly trying new things. Working in different companies, I was developing **front-end/back-end** applications on **nodejs/rust**, setting up **CI/CD**, and also promoted **DevOps** culture within the company.

My Experience (current stack is **bold**):

- **Frontend**: JS/TS, Wasm(Rust), **SolidJS** (also vue, svelte, react, qwik)
- **Backend**: **Rust**, NodeJS, SQL (postgres), NoSQL (mongodb, firestore, elasticsearch, redis)
- **CI/CD**: Docker, **k8s**, Github/Gitlab Actions, Google Cloud
- **Design**: Figma, AdobeXD
- **Language**: Russian, English (B1)

I know how to read docs, listen and explain

Interested in creating something new and weird all the time
